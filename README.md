# Restaurant-App-Backend

# ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features and Functionality 

1. Login System
The program starts by asking for a username and password.
Access is restricted to admin with password 1234.
Once logged in, it enables full management of the restaurant system.
Includes a logout feature that safely exits the session.

2. Persistent Data Storage (File Handling)
Data for branches, customers, and menu items is stored in plain text files:
branches.txt
customers.txt
menu.txt
On startup, it loads existing data from these files.
On modification, it saves updates back to the files.
This ensures data persists even after the program closes ‚Äî a lightweight substitute for a database.

3. Fake Data Initialization
If the files are empty, the program automatically populates:
Three branches with preset sales figures.
Three customers with join dates.
Five menu items with prices.
A very practical design choice: ensures your program always has testable data.

4. Branch Management
Add, remove, or list branches.
Each branch stores a name and total sales.
Export feature: creates a CSV sales report (branch_name_sales.csv) for easy access in Excel or Sheets.
Example: exporting Dha Branch creates Dha_Branch_sales.csv.

5. Customer Management
Add, remove, or view customers.
Each record includes the customer name and join date.
Data is saved to customers.txt automatically.
Helps maintain a lightweight customer database.

6. Menu Management
Add, remove, or list dishes.
Each menu item includes a dish name and price.
Data stored in menu.txt, ensuring it persists after exit.
Serves as a simple POS (Point of Sale) backend foundation.

8. Sales Dashboard
Aggregates and displays total data across the system:
Total branches
Total customers
Total menu items
Total sales across all branches
Uses formatted output (iomanip) for a clean, professional terminal display.
